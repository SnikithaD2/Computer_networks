How to run basic Nmap scans (commands)

Install:

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install nmap

Windows: download from nmap.org and install

Basic host discovery (ping scan):

nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24


Simple port scan (top ports):

nmap 192.168.1.10


Full TCP scan (all ports):

nmap -p- 192.168.1.10


Service/version detection:

nmap -sV 192.168.1.10


Operating system detection:

sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.10


Aggressive scan (combines some probes):

nmap -A 192.168.1.10

What the results mean (simple)

open port → a service is listening (like a shop open for business).

closed → port reachable but nothing listening.

filtered → the robot couldn’t tell because a firewall blocked it.

OS detection will show a guessed OS and confidence.
